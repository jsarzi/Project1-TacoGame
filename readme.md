##BABY TACO GOES TO THE USA

#Why I choose this game?

I wanted to challenge me using canvas. And I throught it will be interested to have some collision with some condition.
I changed the story and added more level while working on this project.

##Key features

Collision: The taco has to identify when he hits an object
Condition: depend of the object, the taco will loose, win points or even loose the game.
Canvas
Elements that disepear in an array

#What's next?
Improve the css and implement more level
